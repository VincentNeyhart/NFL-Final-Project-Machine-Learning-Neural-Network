# NFL Final Project - Machine Learning and Neural Networks
This project explores game patterns of games from the National Football League (NFL) to predict win outcomes and point differentials. Using a substantial amount of feature engineering on ten years' worth of game data, we identified key performance metrics and trends to inform predictive modeling. The main analysis for this project utilizes a multi-output neural network to capture intricate relationships between team and player statistics. The model was designed to reduce overfitting while highlighting influential features to predict win probability and scoring margins. The results of running this reflect meaningful insights that could impact decision-making and further the development of sporting analytical tools.
